# Website Positioning & Wording Guidelines

## Purpose

This document explains how the AI receptionist product should be positioned and described on the website for clinic owners, doctors, and office managers.

The Product Design & Requirements Document (PDR) explains what the product does.  
This document explains how that product should be communicated.

## 1. Overall Tone & Positioning

The website should sound:
- Professional
- Calm
- Operational
- Reassuring
- Confident, not hype-driven

Avoid:
- Futuristic or sci-fi language
- “AI replacing humans” framing
- Buzzwords without operational meaning

Emphasize:
- Reliability
- Simplicity
- Existing workflows
- Reduced staff burden

Core emotional takeaway:

**“This makes my clinic easier to run, and I don’t have to change anything.”**

## 2. Core Pitch

The product should be framed as:

**An AI-powered receptionist for private clinics that answers calls, manages appointments, and works directly with the clinic’s existing scheduling system.**

Key framing points:
- Sits on top of existing software
- Does not replace clinic systems
- No migration or retraining
- Uses the clinic’s current phone number
- Appointments appear in the PMS as if booked by staff

## 3. Homepage Messaging

The homepage should clearly answer:
- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- Why does it help me?
- What do I not have to change?

Emphasize:
- Reduced front-desk workload
- 24/7 call handling
- Accurate appointment booking
- No disruption to operations

Calls to action:
- “Schedule a Demo”
- “See How It Works”

Avoid aggressive sales language.

## 4. Features Page

Describe features in terms of problems solved, not technology.

Include:
- 24/7 AI phone receptionist
- Appointment booking, rescheduling, cancellation
- Direct PMS integration
- Answers common clinic questions
- SMS confirmations and reminders
- Emergency and urgent call handling
- Safeguards to prevent booking errors

Make it clear that:
- Bookings are carefully confirmed
- Errors fall back safely to staff review
- Nothing happens silently

## 5. Use Cases

Show applicability to real clinics:
- Dental clinics
- Med spas / aesthetic clinics
- Chiropractic clinics
- Other appointment-based practices

Reassure clinics that:
- The product understands appointment workflows
- It adapts without heavy customization
- It is not one-size-fits-all

## 6. Integrations Page

This page builds trust.

Clearly state:
- Works with existing scheduling systems
- No software replacement
- No workflow changes for staff

Use phrasing like:
- “Works with your existing scheduling system”
- “No migration required”
- “Fits into what you already use”

## 7. What Should Be Repeated Across the Site

- Works with your existing systems
- No disruption to clinic operations
- Designed for private clinics
- Reduces front-desk workload
- Improves patient access
- Handles appointments accurately

Repetition builds confidence.

## 8. What the Website Should Avoid

Do not:
- Claim the product replaces staff
- Claim it manages medical records
- Imply clinics must switch systems
- Oversell AI intelligence
- Sound experimental or beta

The product should sound stable, operational, and boring (in a good way).

## 9. Final Reader Mental Model

After reading the site, a doctor should think:

**“This is basically a receptionist that answers my phone, books appointments correctly in my current system, and saves my staff time — without me having to change how my clinic runs.”**
