# Product Brief: AI Receptionist for Private Clinics

## What We Sell

An AI-powered phone receptionist that answers calls 24/7, books appointments, and writes them directly into the clinic's existing scheduling software. No new tools for staff to learn—appointments just appear like they were booked by a human.

## Who It's For

- Small to mid-sized private clinics
- Dental offices
- Med spas & aesthetic clinics
- Chiropractic offices
- Specialty practices

The buyer is typically the practice owner or office manager looking to reduce front-desk workload and never miss a call again.

## The Problem We Solve

Clinics miss calls. Phones ring while staff are busy with patients. After-hours calls go to voicemail. Every missed call is a missed appointment—and lost revenue.

Hiring more receptionists is expensive. Training takes time. Turnover is constant.

## Our Solution

An AI receptionist that:
- Answers every call, 24/7
- Handles common questions (hours, location, services, insurance basics)
- Books, reschedules, and cancels appointments
- Writes directly into the clinic's existing system (Open Dental, Dentrix, etc.)
- Sends SMS confirmations and reminders
- Only escalates to staff when truly necessary

It works like a real receptionist, not a clunky phone tree or chatbot.

## Core Value Proposition

**"An AI receptionist that books appointments directly into your existing system—so your staff doesn't have to answer the phone."**

## Key Benefits

- **No missed calls** — Every call gets answered, even at 2am
- **No workflow change** — Staff keep using their existing software
- **No new UI to learn** — Appointments just appear in the schedule
- **Reduced labor costs** — Front desk can focus on in-office patients
- **SMS confirmations** — Patients get instant booking confirmations

## What It's NOT

- Not a patient portal
- Not an EHR or medical records system
- Not a billing tool
- Not a replacement for their scheduling software

It handles conversations and appointments only.

## Target Market (Starting Point)

Dental offices using Open Dental as their practice management system.
